Installation
============

Install the latest release using pip (``pip install revdbc``) or manually from source by running ``pip install .`` (preferred) or ``python setup.py install`` in the cloned repository. Doing so installs both the library for programmatic usage and an executable called ``revdbc``. Use ``revdbc --help`` for usage information.
